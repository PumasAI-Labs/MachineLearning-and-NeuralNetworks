This workshop provides an introduction to **machine learning and neural networks in DeepPumas**. Through a series of examples and exercises, it showcases the DeepPumas functionality and syntax for machine learning and neural networks, and introduces fundamental concepts and Generalization. 

!!! success "Prerequisites"

    The workshop is targeted to users familiar with statistical modeling and pharmacometrics who want to take advantage of DeepPumas to augment their models with machine learning components. Previous experience in machine learning is helpful but not required. We recommend users being familiar with the Pumas ecosystem and workflows, as covered in the [NLME Modeling Workshop](https://pumasai-labs.github.io/NLME-Model/) and its pre-requisites.
